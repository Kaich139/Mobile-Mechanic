# Mobile Mechanic

##### Target
In case of tyre burst/puncture, the nearest mechanic with contact details can be found through the app. The mechanics can be registered on the app and they will receive a notification for a nominal charge.

#### Achieved
Mechanic's location is hard-coded initially. We can triangulate our location and within its 5kms radius any mechanic present will be shown on the map. Selecting the nearest mechanic will plot a course from his destination to ours.
